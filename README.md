# Golf Launch Monitor

## Project Overview

This is a hobby project with educational purposes, which I will be working on over the summer. The primary goals of this project are to learn about radar technology and to expand my knowledge of embedded development.

### Project Objective

The product of this project is a golf launch monitor capable of:
- Recording the speed of the club head
- Recording the speed of the ball
- Displaying the recorded data to the user via a screen or other communication means

## Hardware

The hardware components used in this project include:
- **Microcontroller**: Arduino Uno R4 WiFi
- **Radar Module**: (To be decided)
- **Display**: Screen or another device to show the data to the user

## Development Tools

I will be using PlatformIO as the development tool for this project.

## Learning Goals

Through this project, I aim to:
- Gain a deeper understanding of radar technology
- Enhance my skills in embedded development
